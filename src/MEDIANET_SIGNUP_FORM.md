### 6. Monthly Page Views
**What they're asking:** How many pages are viewed on your site per month

**What to provide:** Be honest! Media.net verifies this.

**If you're just launching:**
```
0 - 10,000 page views per month
```

**If you have some traffic:**
```
10,000 - 50,000 page views per month
```

**If you're established:**
```
50,000 - 100,000 page views per month
```

**Important:**
- ✅ Be honest - they'll verify with analytics
- ✅ "Page views" counts every page loaded (not unique visitors)
- ✅ If launching: Select the lowest range
- ❌ Don't exaggerate - this can get you rejected
- ❌ Don't worry if traffic is low - they still approve new sites!

**How to calculate:**
- 1 visitor who views 5 pages = 5 page views
- 1,000 visitors × 5 pages average = 5,000 page views
- Formula: Monthly Visitors × Average Pages Per Visit

**For a new educational site, be realistic:**
```
0 - 10,000 page views/month (or even less is fine!)
```
