# 📋 Simple Copy-Paste Guide (5 Steps Per File)

## The Process for EVERY File

### In Figma Make (this window):

**Step 1:** Look at the LEFT side of this window
- You'll see a list of files (App.tsx, main.tsx, etc.)

**Step 2:** Click on a file name
- The code appears in the main area

**Step 3:** Select all the code
- Click in the code area
- Press **Ctrl+A** (Windows) or **Cmd+A** (Mac)
- Everything turns blue/highlighted

**Step 4:** Copy the code  
- Press **Ctrl+C** (Windows) or **Cmd+C** (Mac)

### On Your Computer:

**Step 5:** Create a new file and paste
- Open Notepad or VS Code
- Paste with **Ctrl+V** (Windows) or **Cmd+V** (Mac)
- Save with the SAME filename (e.g., `App.tsx`)

---

## Example: Let's Copy Your First File Together

### Right Now - Copy `main.tsx`:

#### 1️⃣ In Figma Make (LEFT sidebar):
- See the file list?
- Find `main.tsx`
- **Click on it**

#### 2️⃣ Select all:
- Click anywhere in the code
- Press `Ctrl+A` (or `Cmd+A` on Mac)

#### 3️⃣ Copy:
- Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac)

#### 4️⃣ On your computer:
- Open Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)
- Press `Ctrl+V` (or `Cmd+V`) to paste

#### 5️⃣ Save:
- File → Save As
- Navigate to your Desktop
- Create a folder called `canedugames` (if you haven't already)
- Filename: `main.tsx`
- **Important:** Change "Save as type" to "All Files" (not .txt)
- Click Save

✅ **Done! You just copied your first file!**

## Now Repeat for Every File

Use the same 5 steps for each file in this list:

### Start with these small files (easiest):
1. `main.tsx` ← You just did this! ✅
2. `index.html`
3. `package.json`
4. `vite.config.ts`
5. `tsconfig.json`
6. `vercel.json`

### Then copy this big file:
7. `App.tsx` (this one is long, that's normal!)

### Then create folders and copy into them:

**Create a `components` folder, then copy:**
- `components/Logo.tsx`
- `components/Auth.tsx`
- `components/GameCard.tsx`
- ...and all the other files in the `components` folder

**Create a `contexts` folder, then copy:**
- `contexts/ScoreContext.tsx`
- `contexts/ProgressionContext.tsx`
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Create a `styles` folder, then copy:**
- `styles/globals.css`

**And so on...**

## Shortcuts

### Fastest Method: Use VS Code

1. **Download VS Code:** https://code.visualstudio.com
2. **Install it**
3. **Open VS Code**
4. **Click File → Open Folder**
5. **Select your `canedugames` folder**

Now in VS Code:
- Right-click in the sidebar → **New File**
- Type the filename (e.g., `App.tsx`)
- The file opens automatically
- Paste your code
- It saves automatically!

Much faster than Notepad! 👍

## What If I Miss a File?

Don't worry! You can:
- Add it later
- Copy it and add to your folder
- Push the new file to GitHub
- It will auto-deploy

**Better to get most files now, and add missing ones later!**

---

## How Many Files Total?

You'll be copying approximately:
- **9 root files** (App.tsx, main.tsx, etc.)
- **60+ component files** (in /components folder)
- **3 context files** (in /contexts folder)
- **3 util files** (in /utils folder)
- **3 backend files** (in /supabase folder)
- **1 style file** (globals.css)

**Total: ~80 files**

Don't panic! Most are small. The components folder is the biggest batch.

---

## Time Estimate

- **Using Notepad:** 20-30 minutes
- **Using VS Code:** 10-15 minutes (recommended!)

---

## Quick Checklist

After copying, verify:
- [ ] `canedugames` folder exists on your Desktop
- [ ] `App.tsx` is in the main folder (not in a subfolder)
- [ ] `components` folder exists with files inside
- [ ] `contexts` folder exists with 3 files
- [ ] `styles` folder exists with `globals.css`
- [ ] Open `App.tsx` - does it have lots of code? (Should be 1000+ lines)
- [ ] Open `package.json` - does it have "dependencies"?

If yes to all → You're ready for the next step (GitHub)! 🎉

## Still Confused?

**Tell me:**
1. Do you see the file list on the left side of Figma Make?
2. Can you click on a file and see the code?
3. Do you have Notepad or VS Code on your computer?

I'll help you through it! 🚀

## Alternative: Download as ZIP (if available)

**Check if Figma Make has a download option:**
- Look for a **"Download"** or **"Export"** button
- Look for **"Download ZIP"** or **"Download Project"**
- This would download everything at once!

If you see this option, USE IT! It's much faster than copy-paste.

**Don't see a download button?** No problem, use the copy-paste method above.
