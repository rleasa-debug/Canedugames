# 🎯 Ad Network Alternatives to Google AdSense

Since you can't access Google AdSense, here are the BEST alternatives for your educational site:

## ⭐ RECOMMENDED: Focus on Your Subscription Model

**You already have a $14.99/year subscription working!** This is actually BETTER than ads:

### Why Subscriptions Beat Ads:

| Metric | Ads (1,000 users) | Subscriptions (100 users) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Monthly Revenue | $50-200 | $125/month ($1,500/year) |
| User Experience | Annoying ads | Clean, ad-free |
| Setup Time | 1-2 weeks approval | ✅ Already working! |
| Control | Network decides | ✅ Full control |

**My honest recommendation**: Skip ads entirely and focus on growing subscriptions!
